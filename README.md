# MessAnchor

**This app will help you to select the best messenger for any of your contacts.**

Did it ever happen to you that you messaged your friends on WhatsApp and later found out they also use another messenger which you prefer?
By installing this app, this will never happen again!

When you tap a contact, the app tries to open a chat with this contact inside your favorite messenger.
If the contact doesn't use that messenger, your second favorite messenger will be opened and so on.
